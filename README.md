## 🛠️ How Was This Simulated?

Multiscale computational workflow:
- **DFT (VASP)** → Adsorption energy, charge transfer, DOS
- **AIMD/NEB** → K⁺ diffusion barriers
- **Phase-Field (MOOSE)** → Stress/strain over 500 cycles
- **KMC** → Rate performance modeling
- **FEA (COMSOL)** → Electrode-level conductivity & impedance

No experiments were harmed in the making of this anode.
