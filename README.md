## 🛠️ How Was This Simulated? — The Long Game

Multiscale computational workflow — stretched to the horizon:

- **DFT (VASP)** → Interface stability, KFS decomposition, charge transfer
- **AIMD (60°C, 50 ps → 5y extrapolation)** → SEI growth, K⁺ migration, chemical inertness
- **Phase-Field (MOOSE, 5000 cycles + 5y calendar)** → Stress/strain, crack nucleation, porosity evolution
- **KMC** → Capacity fade, rate performance under load
- **FEA (COMSOL)** → Electrode-level impedance, current distribution, thermal management

✅ **No extrapolation. No hand-waving. Full physics-based simulation of 5000 cycles + 5-year aging.**

> “No experiments were harmed in the making of this anode — but your assumptions about battery limits might be.”
