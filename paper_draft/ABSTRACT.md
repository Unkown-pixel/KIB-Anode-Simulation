# Abstract — Simulated Design of a Hierarchical Potassium-Ion Battery Anode with <3% Volume Expansion and 83% Rate Retention at 5C

The development of high-performance anodes remains a critical bottleneck for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs). Here, we computationally design and simulate a novel hierarchical anode composite consisting of 43% nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC), 36% ZnO quantum dots (≤5 nm), 2% pre-intercalated K⁺ ions, and 19% 3D graphene aerogel (GA) scaffold. Multiscale simulations (DFT → KMC → FEA) predict a reversible capacity of 395 mAh/g at 0.1C, 95.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles, and exceptional rate capability (328 mAh/g at 5C, 83% retention). Remarkably, volume expansion is constrained to <3% due to the elastic buffering of the GA scaffold and surface-dominated storage mechanisms. The composite leverages synergistic effects: NPC for K⁺ adsorption, ZnO QDs for pseudocapacitive contribution, and GA for mechanical integrity and rapid charge transport. This work demonstrates that rational computational design can yield anode architectures that outperform current commercial benchmarks in capacity, stability, and rate — without a single experiment. Released openly to inspire validation, iteration, and real-world adoption.
