 SIMULATED MANUFACTURING PROTOCOL ‚Äî FOR INSPIRATION ONLY

This is a *simulated* material. No synthesis has been performed.
But if you want to try building it, here‚Äôs a hypothetical scalable route:

1. **Synthesize 3D Graphene Aerogel (19%)**
   - Use freeze-casting of GO dispersion + thermal reduction
   - Target pore size: 50‚Äì200 nm, density ~50 mg/cm¬≥

2. **Prepare ZnO Quantum Dots (36%, ‚â§5 nm)**
   - Sol-gel synthesis with oleylamine capping
   - Purify, disperse in ethanol

3. **Infiltrate ZnO QDs into GA Scaffold**
   - Use vacuum-assisted infiltration or supercritical CO‚ÇÇ infusion
   - Anneal at 200¬∞C to remove surfactant

4. **Coat with Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon (43%)**
   - Infiltrate with polyaniline (PANI) solution
   - Carbonize at 800¬∞C under N‚ÇÇ ‚Üí creates NPC wrapping

5. **Pre-dope with K‚Å∫ (2%)**
   - Vapor-phase exposure to K metal at 150¬∞C under Ar
   - Or electrochemical pre-potassiation in half-cell

6. **Electrode Fabrication**
   - Grind composite, mix with PVDF/binder (80:10:10)
   - Cast on Cu foil, dry, compress

‚ö†Ô∏è This is speculative. Validate safety, stoichiometry, and dispersion in lab.
